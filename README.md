## About our Website:

ZotSteps, a fun website that tracks the amount of steps UCI students take if it wasn’t online. When heading to class is no longer an option, students aren’t getting much physical exercise. That’s why ZotSteps is here to show YOU the number of steps needed in-person as a reminder to move around more.
